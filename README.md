# OrbitGame

The goal of this game is to collect as many points as possible before colliding with one of the red obstacles. Jump in and out of different levels in orbit to dodge the obstacles. Gain points by collecting the green circles. Try using the outer orbits to move around faster, use the inner most orbits when you wanna relax a bit.

Use the "F" key to jump inward, and the "J" key to jump outward.
